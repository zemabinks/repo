# Install ZGTA V with Sileo

**Requires iOS / iPadOS 15.0 or later**, a compatible installation method and your own matching prepared game files.

[Full installation guide](https://github.com/zemabinks/ZGTA-V/blob/main/docs/START-HERE.md) · [Other iOS sideloaders](https://github.com/zemabinks/ZGTA-V/blob/main/docs/IOS-SIDELOADING.md) · [Mods, graphics & multiplayer](https://github.com/zemabinks/ZGTA-V/blob/main/docs/PLAY-GUIDE.md)

## TrollStore / TrollStore Lite

1. Make sure compatible TrollStore / TrollStore Lite is already installed. The app's iOS minimum does not mean TrollStore supports every later iOS version.
2. In Sileo → Sources, add `https://zemabinks.github.io/repo/` and refresh.
3. Install **ZGTA V (TrollStore installer)**, version **0.104-1**.
4. Open **ZGTA V → Game files** and choose your prepared folder or archive. Follow the [game-file instructions](https://github.com/zemabinks/ZGTA-V/blob/main/docs/START-HERE.md#required-game-folder).

To update, install over the existing app. Do not delete the app or its data first. Removing the small Sileo package leaves ZGTA V installed.

If Sileo shows Reinstall, cannot find the package or reports **Install Identifier Mismatch**, clear the queued attempt, refresh Sources and reopen the package. If the helper cannot be found, check TrollStore or install the [same IPA](https://github.com/zemabinks/repo/releases/download/zgta-v-build-104/ZGTA-V-Build104-Fade-State-TrollStore.ipa) manually through it.

## AppSync — experimental

For compatible **ARM64 rootful jailbreaks on iOS 15.0–18.2** without TrollStore. This installer is **not for RootHide or rootless**. Actual installation and gameplay have not been tested.

1. Add the official AppSync source, `https://cydia.akemi.ai/`, and Zema's Repo in Sileo.
2. Select **ZGTA V (AppSync installer - experimental)**.
3. Check the dependencies: **AppSync Unified 116.0+**, **appinst 2.1.1+**, curl and coreutils. Let Sileo resolve and configure them.
4. Install, then try opening ZGTA V with the compatible jailbreak active. Report the exact error if it fails.

Do not install both ZGTA V installer packages. The AppSync installer will not replace a detected TrollStore-managed copy. Removing either installer package leaves the app/data in place.

Fresh downloads from the official dependency server could not be verified during the last check. If Sileo cannot fetch the dependencies, installation cannot proceed. AppSync does not guarantee this game's memory needs or TrollStore-style persistence. Do not remove a working app to test it.

## Sideloadly / AltStore Classic

The same `.ipa` is the input for these signing tools; use the [sideloading guide](https://github.com/zemabinks/ZGTA-V/blob/main/docs/IOS-SIDELOADING.md) for steps and limits. These ZGTA V routes remain experimental. Use `.ipa`, not a Sileo `.deb` or TrollStore `.tipa`.

## Remote multiplayer

## Downloads and support

[Build 104](https://github.com/zemabinks/repo/releases/tag/zgta-v-build-104) contains the current Sileo candidate IPA, installers and checksums. Build 104 corrects stale fade state after original game resets. All 12 authenticated engine-state sequences pass; retained Build 103 fails seven expected cases. Shader code, memory settings, cooling, saves and networking are unchanged. Owner testing rejected Build 103 for the flickering-building scene. Exact Build 104 iPhone/Mac visual acceptance remains pending; no complete scene fix or FPS gain is claimed. Updating through either installer preserves existing app data.

If installation fails, share the exact Sileo error. For an in-app problem, use **Settings → Saves & support → Share log**. Review personal paths and addresses before posting; do not upload game files or private saves.
